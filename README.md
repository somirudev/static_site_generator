# static site generator

This is another [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project

was a fun learning experience!

main.sh converts markdown files nested within the content directory to html files in docs directory (if run locally). With github pages it skips that step and instead generates the pages in a VM (build.sh) and hosts them at https://somirudev.github.io/static_site_generator/
